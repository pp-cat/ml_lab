Association rules overview
Association rule learning finds if–then relationships between items in transactional data; common algorithms include Apriori and FP-Growth.

Minimal Python example using mlxtend (Apriori + rules)
# install: pip install mlxtend pandas
import pandas as pd
from mlxtend.preprocessing import TransactionEncoder
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori, association_rules

# sample transactions
transactions = [
    ['milk', 'bread', 'butter'],
    ['beer', 'diapers'],
    ['milk', 'diapers', 'beer', 'bread'],
    ['bread', 'butter'],
    ['milk', 'bread', 'diapers', 'butter'],
]

# one-hot encode transactions
te = TransactionEncoder()
te_ary = te.fit(transactions).transform(transactions)
df = pd.DataFrame(te_ary, columns=te.columns_)

# find frequent itemsets with minimum support 0.4
freq_itemsets = apriori(df, min_support=0.4, use_colnames=True)

# generate rules with minimum confidence 0.7
rules = association_rules(freq_itemsets, metric="confidence", min_threshold=0.7)

print(freq_itemsets)
print(rules[['antecedents','consequents','support','confidence','lift']])

Explanation of key steps and metrics
- Convert transactions into a Boolean (one-hot) encoded DataFrame using TransactionEncoder.
- Use apriori to discover frequent itemsets that meet a support threshold; support is fraction of transactions containing the itemset.
- Use association_rules to generate candidate rules from frequent itemsets and filter by metrics such as confidence and lift.

Example interpretation
- A rule {bread, butter} → {milk} with support 0.4 and confidence 0.75 means 40% of transactions contain all three items and in 75% of transactions that contain bread and butter, milk is also present. Lift >1 indicates positive association beyond chance.

Practical notes and references
- For larger datasets use FP-Growth (available in mlxtend) or optimized implementations to avoid combinatorial explosion.
- The code pattern above and explanations follow common tutorials and how-to guides for Apriori and mlxtend implementations.
